                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Poverty is a situation of inequality and deprivation that happens infavourably for poor households in
                    many developing countries. In Malaysia, poverty is defined as the percentage of households that has a
                    gross monthly household income lower than the predetermined Poverty Line Income (PLI). The PLI is
                    different across strata and Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, where rural areas record a lower
                    PLI in comparison to urban area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Malaysia has revised its national PLI from RM980 to RM2,208 in 10 July 2020 after introducing an updated 
                    2019 calculation methodology, indicating that 5.6% of Malaysian households are currently living in absolute 
                    poverty. Absolute poverty refers to the situation whereby an individual or household cannot afford to 
                    fulfill his/her basic needs for a minimally comfortable and secure living. Minister in the Prime Minister's 
                    Department (Economy) Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed said the issue of national poverty was placed as a priority 
                    under the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP), which among others, focused specifically on eliminating hardcore 
                    poverty as well as reducing socio-economic inequality by implementing comprehensive and targeted programmes.
                </p>
                <h3>Poverty post-COVID-19</h3>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 pandemic has had a major economic impact on Malaysia, particularly on vulnerable households. 
                    These include those with little or no assets or savings to fall back on, informal workers who are not 
                    covered by or have inadequate social safety nets, and those who have lost their jobs, been placed on 
                    unpaid leave, or experienced pay cuts because of movement control orders (MCO). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the UN study titled "Families On The Edge", low-income households headed by women like widows 
                    and single mothers are among the worst affected, with higher rates of unemployment and a pessimistic 
                    outlook on prospects for recovery in the next six months. Although there were various forms of government 
                    assistance given during the MCO, cash assistance was regarded as the most useful. The respondents also 
                    preferred sustainable assistance such as employment, and longer-term aids rather than just one-off cash handouts.
                </p>
                <h3>Poverty eradication strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    Under the present Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), Malaysia continues to focus on effort to address 
                    multi-dimensional and relative poverty issues by reducing inequality and improve income disparity as well 
                    as narrowing the development gaps between regions. Malaysia has also embarked with a more focus development 
                    strategies to address socio-economic uncertainty and vulnerability among the bottom 40% (B40) household which 
                    include women, children, youth, elders and persons with disabilities (PWDs) to face greater challenges 
                    of modern urban life through a more integrated and comprehensive social protection system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector in Malaysia have complemented Government effort to
                    redress poverty in recent years. Working in close cooperation with one another and complementing government efforts, 
                    they provide, inter alia, small business loans to the poor as well as industrial training and job opportunities, 
                    educational support for children of the poor and better housing. Among the NGOs, the Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) 
                    has been the most successful poverty eradication model in Malaysia. AIM not only offers financial products and 
                    services to the poor, but also a wide range of services including financial education, entrepreneurship
                    training, value change support and social services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the rural areas, various community development programmes was implemented by CSOs namely KEMAS and JKKK to provide 
                    opportunities to the rural poor to improve their socio-economic wellbeing through child care, pre-school classes 
                    etc. In the urban areas, RUKUN TETANGGA committees programmes was expanded to include social outreach activities, 
                    which focused on specific target groups, particularly among the poor households. Malaysia continues to provide 
                    greater enabling environment for the private sector as well as NGOs to doubled-up effort to assist the poor. In the 
                    urban areas, the private sector will continue to assist the Government in the construction of infrastructure as well 
                    as the low-cost housing for the poor and the lower income groups.
